- Update woefully outdated README
- Fix OOB caused by `\integral[inf] x(t)`
- Provide shortened version of `\widetilde` and `\overline` ?
- Make `\integral` shorter, like `\summ`?
- `\wrt` tag that expands to end of integral (`\,\mathrm{d}<stuff>`)?
- Use `set` members to speed up key lookup?
- Make parsing functions that take a ParseInfo as a reference members of ParseInfo, and make it a class
- Have errors and warnings reported on the line the problem starts on, not the one it ends on.
