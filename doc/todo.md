- Update woefully outdated README
- Provide shortened version of `\widetilde` and `\overline` ?
- Make `\integral` shorter, like `\summ`?
- `\wrt` tag that expands to end of integral (`\,\mathrm{d}<stuff>`)?
- Have errors and warnings reported on the line the problem starts on, not the one it ends on.
